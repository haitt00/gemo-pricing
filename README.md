# PRICING

## Approach
Overall, the requirements in this assignment are not particularly challenging to implement. However, they are vivid examples of how the codebase of projects is forced to change to adapt to new requirements. 

Each such change in the codebase introduces additional complexity and disorder that needs to be taken care of using constant cleaning and refactoring with the insurance of unit tests. In other words, in order to sustain the development pace (and growth) of projects, we need to write unit tests.

Based on the reasoning above, my approach to this assignment is to focus on demonstrating how to write good unit tests and how they help you make right changes to the code of an evolving project.

## Project organization
For each (additional) requirement, you can find:
- code implementation folder under `/src/req[index]`
- unit tests under file `/tests/calculatePrice[index].spec.ts`

## Tests evaluation
Based on four attributes:
- Protection against regressions
-  Resistance to refactoring
-  Fast feedback
-  Maintainability
